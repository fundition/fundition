  "HOW_IT_WORKS_ADVANTAGES_FUNDITION": "Advantages of Fundition — Compared with Other Platforms",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_WHAT_BENEFIT_FUNDITION_DESCRIPTION": "Both Founders and Backers benefit greatly from Fundition. Backers have a one-on-one relationship with the Founder, and they are rewarded in two ways by giving to projects. First, they receive rewards from the Founder, and second, they receive rewards (in HeartPower) for any contribution, no matter how small. Founders benefit by receiving contributions directly, with no fees, from Backers. And Founders also receive ongoing rewards (in Hearts and HeartPower) for content, updates, and final delivery. ",

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_STEEM_DESCRIPTION": "Steem (http://steem.io) is a blockchain-based rewards platform, upon which users are able to monetize their content, and grow their community. It is also a next-generation blockchain, uniquely designed to run real-time applications with near instant, fee-less transactions. \n\nSteem has been battled-tested since 2016, and has the capability of processing more transactions per second than Bitcoin and Ethereum combined. ",
  "COMMON_FOUNDER_DESCRP": "A Founder is a user who has successfully created a Fundition campaign. After the initiation of a campaign, a user will be granted the title Founder, and given the access that goes along with the role. While creating the project, a Founder can designate other beneficiaries to be assigned a fixed percentage of the campaign‘s remuneration. ",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_BLOCKCHAINS_DESCRIPTION": "Due to its reliability, immutability, and superior data architecture, blockchain technology is already becoming ubiquitous across all sectors. However, blockchain is extremely complex for non-technical individuals. \n\nFundition is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that will allow mainstream users (without knowledge of blockchain or cryptocurrency) to begin using blockchain-anchored technology to acquire, give, and receive cryptocurrency tokens, towards the support of founders, without any fees. That user (either founder or backer) can choose to never learn about blockchain or cryptocurrency, simply following instructions for converting their earnings to fiat, or they can choose to learn (as part of the platform) how to speak about and employ this cutting edge technology in novel ways. ",

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_COLLABORATOR": "Collaborator",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_COLLABORATOR_DESCR": "A Collaborator is a user who decides to support a project (without necessarily giving financially).

",

We have provided all necessary tools to help you publish via the Fundition platform, and if your project respects the rules, you will be open to donations from the community and any Fundition backers. Backers will have access to multiple channels for donation, and they may make contributions in many currencies, including: $, Euro, BTC, ETH, STEEM, and more. Donations will then be automatically converted via Blocktrade.us, which will rapidly convert donations into Steem.",

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_AUTOMATIC": "WHAT IS AUTOMATIC PAYMENT CONVERSION?",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_AUTOMATIC_DESCR": "All funds donated will be converted to Steem before transfer to the Founder.

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_RECEIVING_FUNDS": "RECEIVING FUNDS FROM COLLABORATORS",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_RECEIVING_FUNDS_DESCR": "Because all projects are decentralized, and may not be easily cancelled, Backers must give directly to – and thus enter into a peer-to-peer agreement with – the Founder.

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_GET_PAID_DESCR": "Fundition does not transact in fiat currency, even if we display USD or EUR to approximate donations, rewards, and goals. However, we are looking into options for the integration of fiat currency in the near future. More importantly, we are striving to be accessible to both the cryptocurrency-fluent and lay community, and hope to be a gateway between the two. ",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_LEGAL": "Legal issues",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_LEGAL_DESCR": "While many crowdfunding platforms allow for invited users to help create or manage a crowdfunding campaign, no other platforms encourage collaboration with the ecosystem of givers. We have introduced a structure in Fundition that allows diverse contributions from users around the world, with all parties benefitting from the common work product. We are able to do this, because the blockchain allows for peer-to-peer collaboration, and the collection of funds is not centralized by us (we don’t take fees, and the relationship is directly from Founder to Backer). Please check your country’s laws governing such fundraising or collaboration. Fundition is not responsible for any fees or taxes; we are simply a platform for the relationship development and content creation, and we are not directly party to the financial transactions. ",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_DONOR": "BACKER",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_DONOR_DESCR": "A user who supports a Fundition project will become a Backer.

(This relationship is not managed or in any way moderated by Fundition.)",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_HOW_SUPPORT": "How do you support a Founder, or donate to his/her project?",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_HOW_SUPPORT_DESCR": "There are two ways to give with Fundition.\n\nThe first way to give is to support the project using your Steem account. You can upvote the project that you want to support on the Fundition platform. You will then be displayed as a Supporter, and not a Backer. You can also purchase HeartPower, in order to give more Hearts and support multiple projects and Founders. \n\nThe second way to give is to send donations directly to the project, using fiat or crypto currency; you will be a Backer. Backers have multiple ways to donate, and when cryptocurrency or fiat currency donations are received, they will automatically be converted into Steem currency, before being sent directly to the Founder’s Steem wallet. ",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_LIFETIME": "How does lifetime support work? ",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_LIFETIME_DESCR": "When making a donation, the Backer will have the option to make a lifetime donation. That means that the Backer can choose an amount of currency he/she wants to purchase, in order to give a lifetime worth of upvotes.",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_CURRENCIES": "WHICH CURRENCIES ARE ACCEPTED?",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_CURRENCIES_DESCR": "Since we are working on the Steem blockchain, we transact in Steem, SBD and SP. However, in order to keep our platform mainstream and accessible, we also accept USD, EUR, and most major cryptocurrencies.",

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_EXPECTATIONS_DESCR": "With Fundition, you can directly ask questions to the Founder, and they are responsible for replying to your comments or concerns. If you don’t get any replies, you can give a review, and alert the public that the Founder is not safe. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the blockchain peer-to-peer transaction, if the Founder does not fulfill his/her promise, we cannot guarantee a refund.

  "HOW_IT_WORKS_GUARANTEE": "IS THERE ANY GUARANTEE?",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_GUARANTEE_DESCR": "The users of our platform (Backer, Founder, Collaborator) are solely responsible for asking questions and investigating the Founder of a project before making a pledge.

Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that pledges will be used properly by Founders, that the Founders will provide the promised rewards, or that the project will achieve the promised outcome. Fundition does not warrant, make any representations, or provide any warranties, as to the reliability or accuracy of any user’s content posted via the Fundition platform on the Steem blockchain. Founders are solely responsible for their reputation, and Backers are solely responsible for their decision to directly support any project. ",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_SAFE": "Is my payment safe?",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_SAFE_DESCR": "If you are a Steem accountholder, You will log into Fundition securely via SteemConnect. For those without Steem accounts, you will be securely taken to BlockTrades or Changelly for any cryptocurrency donations, and to CoinBase for credit donations.",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_SHARING": "SHARING REWARDS BETWEEN COLLABORATORS",
  "HOW_IT_WORKS_SHARING_DESCR": "All Steem, SBD, and SP donations and upvotes will be automatically divided, according to the Founder’s allocation preferences (determined upon project creation). Due to the decentralized peer-to-peer nature of Fundition, all direct donations will only be received by the Founder, and not divided among collaborators automatically; in this case, he/she will have to send Steem to any collaborators manually (unless Fundition someday owns its own exchange).
